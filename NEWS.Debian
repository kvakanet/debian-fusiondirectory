The FusionDirectory schema's have been moved to a new place, they are now
in /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory.

You have to adapt you slapd.conf accordingly

# These should be present for FusionDirectory.
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/gosystem.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/gofon.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/gofax.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/goto.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/goserver.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/gosa-samba3.schema
include         /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/trust.schema

After adapting you can remove the fusiondirectory schema's from /etc/ldap/schema
